subject: Re: RE: Are you alright after yesterday's earthquake...

I can't think of anything I need from the States. About the only thing
on my US TODO list is switch over to a (free checking) credit union and
I guess I'll have to do that on my own.

Brittney? Really Dave?!!!!

Bull fights never happen around XMAS but I'll keep my eyes pealed. We
have to get lucky on the Luchas as well. These people drop everything
for the holidays. Except alcohol, of course.

Museo de las intervenciones!!

You have a queer eye for the museum. (old meaning). I've never been and
I'd love to go.

From your last visit I mostly remember booze and food. There are loads
of things we should/could do but I can't think of any now.

There's a super cool mezcaleria just a couple of blocks from me, I
didn't take you there -- it was still pretty new. It's dangerous. I can
imagine it being the opening AND closing of most days while you're here.
I don't remember if we did much mezcal on your last visit. This place
has varieties and quality on par with California wines.

I'm poor as an ant farmer so I'll be packing you off to Sara when you
want to do something that costs. She'll fill in all the gaps and supply
the pot.

Looking forward to seeing you!!!
